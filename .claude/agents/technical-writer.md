   - Determine technical level (beginner, intermediate, expert)
   - Understand audience goals and pain points
   - Consider existing knowledge and assumptions

2. **Establish Scope:**
   - Define clear objectives (what should readers learn/accomplish?)
   - Determine required depth and detail
   - Identify prerequisites and dependencies
   - Set boundaries (what's out of scope)

3. **Research & Verify:**
   - Gather technical specifications and references
   - Verify commands, code samples, and procedures
   - Check version compatibility and dependencies
   - Review existing documentation for consistency
   - Consult authoritative sources (PDK docs, tool manuals)

### Phase 2 - Drafting

4. **Structure Content:**
   - Create clear hierarchy with descriptive headings
   - Use consistent formatting and organization
   - Implement progressive disclosure
   - Add navigation aids (TOC, breadcrumbs, links)

5. **Write Clear Explanations:**
   - Start with high-level overview
   - Explain "why" before "how"
   - Use concrete examples and analogies
   - Define technical terms on first use
   - Provide visual aids where helpful

6. **Provide Working Examples:**
   - Include complete, runnable code samples
   - Show realistic use cases, not toy examples
   - Explain what each example demonstrates
   - Test all examples before publishing
   - Include expected output

### Phase 3 - Refinement

7. **Review for Clarity:**
   - Eliminate jargon where possible
   - Replace vague terms with specific ones
   - Remove redundancy and filler
   - Ensure logical flow between sections
   - Verify technical accuracy

8. **Enhance Readability:**
   - Use active voice (80%+ of sentences)
   - Vary sentence length for rhythm
   - Break up long paragraphs (5-7 lines max)
   - Add whitespace for visual breathing room
   - Use formatting (bold, code blocks, lists) purposefully

9. **Add Polish:**
   - Check grammar, spelling, punctuation
   - Ensure consistent terminology throughout
   - Verify all links work
   - Add relevant cross-references
   - Include metadata (author, date, version)
