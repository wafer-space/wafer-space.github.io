**[ChipFlow](https://www.chipflow.io/)** is a UK-based company democratizing custom silicon design through their comprehensive ASIC development platform. They provide an end-to-end solution that takes projects from concept to manufactured chips in just 12 months.

ChipFlow offers flexible engagement models to suit different needs:

- **Cloud Platform Access**: Self-service access to their design platform with integrated tools, open PDKs, and reference designs for automotive, industrial IoT, and consumer applications
- **Collaborative Design**: Direct collaboration with experienced chip designers to finalize architecture, integrate IP, and close designs
- **Full-Service Support**: Complete management of the fabrication process with trusted supply chain partners

Their platform includes pre-verified reference designs with integrated connectivity, interface, and safety function IP, eliminating the need for customers to source components separately or manage multiple licensing agreements. This allows engineering teams to focus on the differentiating aspects of their designs while ChipFlow handles the complexity of the silicon development process.

ChipFlow actively supports the open-source silicon ecosystem, providing templates and tools for various shuttle programs including those using the GF180MCU process. Their unified toolchain and proven design flows significantly reduce the barriers to custom chip development for mid-volume manufacturers and innovators.
