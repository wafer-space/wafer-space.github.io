**[Precision Innovations](https://precisioninno.com/)** is the primary developer of OpenROAD™, the open-source RTL-to-GDS flow widely used for digital designs on GF180MCU. Founded in 2019 by experienced EDA engineers with over 30 years of industry expertise, their unique position as the tool developers—not just users—enables capabilities far beyond what's available in the standard open-source version.

When designing with GF180MCU, nearly everyone relies on OpenROAD for their digital implementation flow. Precision Innovations offers commercial support and enhancements that can be critical when:

- **OpenROAD bugs block your design**: Direct access to the development team means bugs can be fixed in the tools themselves, not worked around
- **Advanced optimization is needed**: Expert assistance using ML-powered optimization tools to achieve better power, performance, and area (PPA) results
- **Custom features are required**: New functionality can be developed specifically for your project's needs

OpenROAD, the tool they develop, has been used for **thousands of successful tapeouts** on GF180MCU and SKY130 through Google-sponsored shuttles and Efabless programs. Their deep knowledge of OpenROAD's capabilities and common challenges enables them to solve complex physical design issues including power delivery network construction, routing congestion, density rule violations, and antenna effects.

Precision Innovations provides several engagement models:

- **Commercial Support**: Expert assistance from the OpenROAD development team for production designs
- **Custom Development**: Tool enhancements, flow modifications, and feature additions tailored to specific requirements
- **Training & Education**: Professional courses taught through UCSC Extension by Precision's engineering leaders
- **Rapid Turnaround**: Automated design flows capable of RTL-to-GDS implementation in under 24 hours

As the "RedHat of OpenROAD," Precision Innovations bridges the gap between open-source accessibility and production-ready reliability. Their team contributes extensively to the open-source project while offering commercial extensions and support for teams that need guaranteed results on GF180MCU designs.

For teams pushing the boundaries of what's possible with OpenROAD on GF180MCU, Precision Innovations offers the expertise and direct tool access that can make the difference between a successful tapeout and project delays.
