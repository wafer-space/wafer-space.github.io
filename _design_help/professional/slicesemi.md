**[Slice Semiconductor](https://www.slicesemiconductor.com/)** SLICE Semiconductor is an Irish based mixed signal IC design service provider which provide low cost ASIC development solutions, in addition to IC design contracting and consulting services. With over 20 years experience, our expertise spans technology nodes from 180 down to 3nm, across multiple foundries, on designs ranging from DC up to 20GHz. With a proven silicon track record, we have built a strong reputation with our growing and loyal customer base, that has seen us serve end applications in both the terestrial and low earth orbit sectors. 

Specifically, our design services include: 

- **Low cost full ASIC development**: Whether you are looking to prototype an idea, productise a prototype or simply reduce the BOM of an existing product, our low cost ASIC development service can meet your needs. By utilisng open source tools and fabricating on more mature processes, we are able to reduce ASIC development costs by up to 50%. Final die can then be delivered as bare die or as packaged parts, with the latter encompasing a wide range of packaging options.

- **Mixed signal IC design contracting and consulting**: Reduce development time with our mixed signal IC design contracting / consultant services, leveraging extensive experience across multiple nodes / foundries (180 down to 3nm), covering, but not limited to: Core analog (voltage / current references, POR, oscillators), high precision analog (current / temperature sensing, low offset / noise opamps, INAs), low power analog (nA designs for audio applications), data converters (CT/DT Sigma Deltas, SAR ADCs, current steered / resistor DACs) , power management (LDO's, charge pumps, bucks), PLLs, clock distribution, ESD/LU and HV design (up to 70V).
