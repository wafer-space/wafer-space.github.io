We're excited to announce a groundbreaking collaboration between wafer.space and Tiny Tapeout, creating a clear pathway from your first silicon experience to full-scale production. This partnership was highlighted by Matt Venn at the FSiC 2025 conference, demonstrating how educational silicon projects can evolve into real products.

## The Perfect Silicon Journey

**Start with Tiny Tapeout**: Get your first design manufactured on silicon for just $50-300. Tiny Tapeout provides an educational platform where you can learn the fundamentals of chip design without the complexity of a full chip project.

**Scale with wafer.space**: When you're ready to move beyond the educational environment, wafer.space offers the next logical step. Transform your Tiny Tapeout learnings into a dedicated chip design with our budget-friendly $6,000-$8,000 silicon manufacturing service.

## Why This Partnership Matters

The collaboration addresses a critical gap in the silicon ecosystem. Traditionally, there's been a massive jump from educational projects to real-world chip manufacturing. With Tiny Tapeout feeding into wafer.space, we've created a smooth progression:

1. **Learn**: Start with Tiny Tapeout to understand the basics
2. **Prototype**: Use the shared tile space to test your concepts
3. **Graduate**: Move to wafer.space for your dedicated chip
4. **Scale**: Continue with wafer.space for production volumes

## Shared Technology Foundation

Both platforms utilize the same GF180MCU process technology, meaning your design knowledge transfers directly. What you learn about timing, power, and area constraints in Tiny Tapeout applies immediately to your wafer.space project.

## Educational to Commercial Pipeline

This partnership creates an unprecedented educational-to-commercial pipeline:

- **Universities** can now offer students a complete silicon journey
- **Startups** can prototype affordably before committing to larger investments
- **Hobbyists** can turn passion projects into viable products
- **Engineers** can gain hands-on experience with real silicon

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your silicon journey? Here's how:

1. **Join Tiny Tapeout**: Start with their next shuttle to get your first design on silicon
2. **Learn the Process**: Understand the GF180MCU technology and design flows
3. **Plan Your Graduation**: When you're ready for a dedicated chip, wafer.space is here
4. **Scale Your Success**: Use our platform for ongoing production needs

The future of accessible silicon manufacturing is here. From $50 educational projects to $6,000 production chips, we're making silicon accessible to everyone.
