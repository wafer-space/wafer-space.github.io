We're announcing a collaboration between wafer.space and Tiny Tapeout, creating a pathway from educational silicon projects to low-volume production. This partnership was highlighted by Matt Venn at the FSiC 2025 conference.

## The Perfect Silicon Journey

**Start with Tiny Tapeout**: Get your first design manufactured on silicon for just $50-300. Tiny Tapeout provides an educational platform where you can learn the fundamentals of chip design without the complexity of a full chip project.

**Transition to wafer.space**: When you're ready for low-volume production, wafer.space offers the next step. Apply your Tiny Tapeout experience to create a dedicated chip design starting at $7,000 for bare dies or $8,500 for wire-bonded chips.

## Why This Partnership Matters

The collaboration addresses a gap in the silicon ecosystem - the jump from educational projects to low-volume chip manufacturing. With Tiny Tapeout and wafer.space, there's now a clearer progression:

1. **Learn**: Start with Tiny Tapeout to understand the basics
2. **Prototype**: Use the shared tile space to test your concepts
3. **Transition**: Move to wafer.space for your dedicated chip
4. **Produce**: Use wafer.space for low-volume production runs

## Common Process Option

Both platforms will offer GF180MCU process technology as an option. Tiny Tapeout is adding GF180MCU support to complement their existing SKY130 and iHP130 processes, providing a cost-effective alternative. Knowledge gained about timing, power, and area constraints in Tiny Tapeout's GF180MCU runs can be applied to wafer.space projects.

## Educational to Production Pipeline

This partnership creates an educational-to-production pipeline:

- **Universities** can offer students a path from education to low-volume production
- **Startups** can prototype affordably before committing to larger investments
- **Hobbyists** can turn passion projects into viable products
- **Engineers** can gain hands-on experience with real silicon

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your silicon journey? Here's how:

1. **Join Tiny Tapeout**: Start with their next shuttle to get your first design on silicon
2. **Learn the Process**: Understand the GF180MCU technology and design flows
3. **Plan Your Transition**: When you're ready for a dedicated chip and low-volume production, wafer.space is available
4. **Continue Production**: Use our platform for ongoing low-volume manufacturing needs

From $50 educational projects to $7,000 low-volume production chips, we're working to make silicon manufacturing more accessible.
