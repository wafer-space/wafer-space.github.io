At the Free Silicon Conference 2025, Matt Venn made a groundbreaking announcement that has excited the open silicon community: Tiny Tapeout has received funding to port their educational infrastructure to GF180MCU and will be running their future tapeouts through wafer.space.

## The Big Announcement

During his presentation at FSiC 2025, Matt Venn revealed that Tiny Tapeout has secured funding to transition their platform from the current 130nm SkyWater process to the more advanced 180nm GlobalFoundries process (GF180MCU). This move represents a significant step forward for accessible silicon education and prototyping.

**Key highlights from the announcement:**
- **Funding secured** for GF180MCU infrastructure port
- **Partnership established** with wafer.space for manufacturing
- **Enhanced capabilities** with the GF180MCU process node
- **Continued educational focus** with professional-grade results

## Why This Matters

This partnership bridges the gap between education and commercial silicon manufacturing:

### For Students and Educators
- Access to more advanced process technology
- Real-world manufacturing through wafer.space
- Seamless transition from learning to production

### For the Silicon Community
- Lower barrier to entry for chip design
- More affordable prototyping options
- Stronger educational foundation for the industry

### For wafer.space
- Educational pipeline feeding into production services
- Broader community engagement
- Validation of accessible silicon manufacturing model

## Technical Advantages of GF180MCU

The move to GF180MCU brings several benefits:
- **Better performance** compared to 130nm processes
- **More design options** with advanced features
- **Industry relevance** - GF180MCU is widely used in production
- **Tool compatibility** with modern design flows

## What's Next

The transition is already underway, with Tiny Tapeout working on:
1. **Infrastructure porting** - Adapting their educational platform
2. **Design kit integration** - Ensuring seamless student experience  
3. **Manufacturing partnership** - Coordinating with wafer.space processes
4. **Timeline planning** - Setting expectations for availability

## Join the Journey

Whether you're a student looking to get started in silicon design or an engineer wanting to prototype your next idea, this partnership creates the perfect pathway:

**Start with Tiny Tapeout** → Learn the fundamentals for $50-200  
**Graduate to wafer.space** → Scale to production for $6,000-8,000

The future of accessible silicon manufacturing is here, and it starts with education.
