*This update was originally published on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-run-1/updates/were-live).*

The [wafer.space GF180MCU Run 1 campaign](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-run-1) is now live on Crowd Supply! 

For those who haven't been following along: [wafer.space](https://wafer.space) brings the [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) model to silicon. $7k gets you 1,000 dies. That's $7 per chip from GlobalFoundries' [GF180MCU](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/) process. Real production quantities, not just a handful of prototypes.

Efabless shutting down earlier this year left the open silicon community without a clear path to fabrication. I started wafer.space to rebuild that infrastructure with transparent pricing, predictable timelines, and no gatekeeping - and it's even more affordable now!

## [The timeline](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-run-1#schedule)

- **November 28**: Last day to buy a slot
- **December 3**: GDS submission deadline
- **March 15, 2026**: Target ship date for dies to customers

## What you're getting

20mm² on [GF180MCU](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/), replicated 1,000 times. This is the same mature 180nm mixed-signal process used for tons of production chips and the two [Google open MPW runs](https://developers.google.com/silicon). Five metal layers, MIM caps, poly resistors - all the basics you need for mixed-signal designs, MCUs, sensor interfaces, whatever.

## Get involved

Jump on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43y2t53jpE) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#gf180mcu:fossi-chat.org) if you need help with pad rings, DRC issues, or just want to see what others are building.

Subscribe for future updates including reference designs, highlights of projects being built on GF180MCU, interviews with community members, and technical deep-dives into how things work behind the scenes.

This is about enabling open, community-driven silicon manufacturing to grow and expand.
