*This update was originally published on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-run-1/updates/getting-help).*

Hey everyone,

With the **December 3rd GDS submission deadline** getting closer, I wanted to talk about something that might be on your mind: completing your design on time.

Whether you've already [reserved a slot](https://buy.wafer.space/) or you're still on the fence because of timeline concerns, this update is for you. The short version: you have options. Professional paid engineering services are available if you want to accelerate your timeline, get expert review, or have someone handle parts (or all) of your design.

## Two Important Things Up Front

**First**: Professional services are completely optional. You can absolutely complete your GF180MCU design independently using the open-source tools, documentation, and community resources. Many participants will do exactly that.

**Second**: The following companies offer paid consulting and engineering services. They're not free support—they're professional partners you can hire to help ensure your success.

## When Might Professional Services Make Sense?

Different people have different needs and constraints. Here are some scenarios where bringing in professional help might accelerate your project or reduce risk:

- ⏰ **Time-Constrained Projects**: Reserved a slot but juggling multiple priorities? Professional help can accelerate your timeline and ensure you meet the December 3rd deadline.

- 🎓 **First-Time Fabrication**: Never taped out a design before? Expert review can catch issues before going to silicon - much cheaper than discovering problems after fabrication.

- 💼 **Commercial Projects**: Building a product for market? Professional contracts establish clear responsibilities, deliverables, and recourse if things go wrong - important when your business depends on it.

- 📊 **Complex Analog/Mixed-Signal**: Sensitive analog circuits or complex interfaces? Experienced designers can optimize performance and help avoid subtle issues that only show up in silicon.

- 🔧 **Tool-Specific Challenges**: Stuck with OpenROAD configuration or hitting tool limitations? Get help from the tool developers themselves - Precision Innovations built OpenROAD.

These are just examples. Maybe you're working on something unique, or you need the contractual accountability that comes with paid professional services. The point is: you get to choose the approach that works for your situation.

## Meet the Companies Offering Design Services

Four companies are offering paid professional services specifically for [wafer.space](https://wafer.space/) GF180MCU designs. They're listed here in alphabetical order:

## Your Design, Your Approach

Think of professional services as part of a spectrum of options, not an all-or-nothing choice:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/images/news/gf180mcu-run-1/getting-help/support-spectrum-independent.svg" alt="" /></td>
    <td><img src="/assets/images/news/gf180mcu-run-1/getting-help/support-spectrum-hybrid.svg" alt="" /></td>
    <td><img src="/assets/images/news/gf180mcu-run-1/getting-help/support-spectrum-fullservice.svg" alt="" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You might handle 90% of your design independently and bring in expert review for critical analog sections. Or maybe you want someone to handle the entire physical design while you focus on verification. The approach you choose depends on your timeline, budget, and where you want to spend your effort.

**Important note about community resources**: The [Discord](https://discord.gg/43y2t53jpE) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#gf180mcu:fossi-chat.org) channels are great places to learn and get guidance from others in the community. However, remember that ultimately you're responsible for your own design—either doing the work directly or paying someone to do it for you. Community members can point you in the right direction, but they're not substitute engineers for your project.

## What Should You Do Next?

### If you haven't purchased a slot yet:

Don't let timeline concerns stop you from [reserving your spot](https://buy.wafer.space/). Professional help is available if you need it, but the **purchase deadline is November 28th**. After that, you're waiting for Run 2.

1. Reserve your slot at [buy.wafer.space](https://buy.wafer.space/)
2. Assess your design timeline and needs
3. Reach out for professional quotes if helpful

### If you've already purchased a slot:

If you're feeling time pressure or want expert assistance, reach out to companies sooner rather than later. The **December 3rd GDS submission deadline** is approaching.

1. Visit [wafer.space/design-help.html](https://wafer.space/design-help.html) for full company details
2. Contact companies directly for quotes and availability
3. Be specific about what you need (review, partial help, full service)

### Free community resources (always available):

- **Discord**: [discord.gg/43y2t53jpE](https://discord.gg/43y2t53jpE)
- **Matrix**: [#gf180mcu:fossi-chat.org](https://matrix.to/#/#gf180mcu:fossi-chat.org)
- **Documentation**: [gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/)

Remember: community members can offer guidance and share their experiences, but you're responsible for executing your design—whether that's by doing the work yourself or hiring professional help.

## Making Silicon Truly Accessible

[wafer.space](https://wafer.space/) exists to make custom silicon affordable. At $7 per chip for production quantities, we've removed the cost barrier to fabrication.

These professional service companies extend that mission by making silicon accessible in another way: offering the option to pay for expertise when you need it. Not everyone has unlimited time to climb the learning curve. Having professional engineering services available means more people can participate in open silicon manufacturing.

Your idea deserves to become real silicon. Whether you get there independently, with community help, with targeted professional help, or through full-service design, what matters is that you get there.
