Less than 48 hours remain in the first shuttle campaign! If you hope to be on this shuttle, place your order now. If you're facing purchasing obstacles, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-run-1/ask-question).

**The Deadline: 28th November 2025 @ 11:59 PM [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)** ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251128T2359&p1=3399)) — After this deadline you'll be waiting until next year for the next shuttle run.

## After You Purchase

Once you've purchased your slot, you have until **3rd December 2025 @ 11:59 PM [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)** ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251203T2359&p1=3399)) to submit your GDS files.

Run [gf180mcu-precheck](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck) locally to verify your design before submitting. The precheck has been and will continue to be updated, so join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/43y2t53jpE) to get notified of changes. This is the same DRC check that [platform.wafer.space](https://platform.wafer.space/) will run, so catching issues locally saves time.

**Submit early!** The DRC queue will get busy as the deadline approaches. If you find problems at the last minute, you may not have time to fix them.

If you run into issues, join the [wafer.space Discord](https://discord.gg/43y2t53jpE). Many people are putting the finishing touches on their designs right now, and problems you encounter have likely been solved by others who can offer guidance.
